# AntTweakBar library

AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers
to quickly add a light and intuitive GUI into OpenGL and DirectX based 
graphic programs to interactively tweak parameters.

This package includes the source version of the AntTweakBar library and some
program examples.

**The original author, Philippe Decaudin, does no longer maintain the code, so
this fork is an attempt to combine the updates that can be found in other
(divergent) forks.**
